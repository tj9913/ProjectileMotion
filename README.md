# ProjectileMotion

ProjectileMotion is a program that takes user input to calculate either velocity, acceleration, time, or displacement of an object in projectile motion. 

# How to use

User inputs all the given values that is known for the object in projectile motion. The program then parses to find the missing value and then determines whether the inputs are computable for projectile motion. If computation is possible, the program outputs the desired value.
